vmShopperFieldFileUpload
========================

## Status 
This plugin is not current working. As I remember it worked great for most checkouts but had issued with checkout as guest due to the lack of a plugin hook.

## Description
This plugin adds the ability to have a "file" shopper field type. Make sure that the 'File Upload Location' is writable. If files are sensitive, ensure the folder location is not web accessable.
